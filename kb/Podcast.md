# Market Awareness Podcast Description (Knowledge Doc)

Podcast: Market Awareness
Publisher: time2.trade
Spotify categories: Investing (primary) / Business (secondary)

---

## 1) Purpose

Reference spec for AI/humans creating show, episode, blog, and social copy. Defines positioning, tone, SEO terms, and non-negotiables using the Market Awareness “BuzzFeed trading” approach: fast payoff, skimmable structure, lists/micro-explainers, safe identity hooks, and clean relatable moments—without hype, signals, or predictions.

---

## 2) Positioning

Calm, professional podcast for futures + forex day traders who want context + timing (not hype). It’s “awareness-first media”: quick-to-consume episodes that reduce surprises around sessions, overlaps, and scheduled macro risk—anchored strictly to New York time.

BuzzFeed trading (adapted): we use engaging formats (lists, mini explainers, “which type are you?” prompts) to make preparation feel effortless, while staying disciplined and non-promotional.

Core promise: clearer context → better preparation → fewer reactive decisions.

---

## 3) Not (non-negotiables)

* No signals
* No predictions
* No trade setups, entries, or exits
* No “edge” claims, secret sauce, or certainty language
* No affiliate or broker promotion
* Not crypto-focused (unless directly relevant to USD/FX macro context)
* No profit promises or performance claims

---

## 4) Audience

Primary: futures + forex day traders who plan around sessions and scheduled releases.
Secondary: anyone using the economic calendar who needs clean timezone handling (New York time).
Subgroups: news avoiders, prop traders, process/framework learners, session-based students (including ICT / TTrades / TheMarketLens vocabulary used neutrally).

---

## 5) Editorial pillars

* Session awareness (Asia / London / New York) + overlaps
* Macro calendar awareness (CPI / NFP / FOMC + other high-impact releases)
* Volatility windows and liquidity shifts (what changes structurally)
* Execution risk (spreads / slippage / liquidity conditions)
* Risk routines + discipline (before/after event behavior, stand-down rules)
* Narratives & regime shifts (risk sentiment), framed as context not direction

---

## 6) Tone rules

Voice: knowledgeable mentor; calm, clear, practical. “Prepared, not pressed.”

Do:

* Explain mechanisms and typical day structure
* Use neutral language (often / tends to / can / may)
* Offer process options and checklists
* Keep it skimmable: short segments, strong headings, clean lists
* Use light, relatable moments that reinforce discipline (no PnL flex, no gambling vibe)

Don’t:

* Directional calls or “what price will do”
* Urgency bait, fear bait, or hype
* Absolutes (“always”, “guaranteed”)
* Shame language; keep it supportive and professional

---

## 7) Terminology rules

Use: New York time; NY/London/Asia session; session overlap; high-impact events; volatility window; liquidity; execution risk; spreads; slippage; scheduled risk.

Allowed (neutral, defined once):

* Killzone = timing window only (not a setup)
* ICT / TTrades / TheMarketLens = referenced as “session-based frameworks” and timing vocabulary, never as trade instructions

Avoid: signals, edge, secret, guaranteed, unlock profits, “this is the move”.

---

## 8) Trust rules

Process > outcomes. Transparent uncertainty. Consistent New York time definitions. If something is unverified, label it or omit it. Frame events as scheduled risk + operational planning, not predictions.

---

## 9) Engagement strategy (BuzzFeed trading, disciplined)

Use these engagement mechanics safely:

* List formats: “5 checks before NY open”
* Micro explainers: “Why spreads widen in 60 seconds”
* Identity hooks: “Are you a session planner or an impulse clicker?” (behavioral awareness, not superiority)
* Quick routines: “Do this before you even open the chart”
* “Send this to a trader who…” lines (light, clean, non-judgy)

Never convert engagement into execution advice. The goal is repeatable preparation.

---

## 10) SEO terms (use naturally; no stuffing)

Primary: market awareness; futures trading; forex trading; economic calendar; high-impact news; CPI; NFP; FOMC; London session; New York session; Asia session; session overlap; volatility; liquidity; slippage; spreads; risk management; prop trading; day trading routine; New York time.

Secondary: trading session times; macro events for traders; how to prepare for CPI; how to trade around NFP (non-signal); FOMC day routine (risk-focused); volatility windows; execution risk.

---
