# Time 2 Trade — X (Twitter) Writing Style Knowledge File
Version: 1.0  
Use: This is the single source of truth for writing Time 2 Trade X posts in **my** voice (trader + developer → trader).  
Goal: **Market awareness + timing clarity** for FX + futures day traders. **Not a signal service.**

---

## Voice DNA (write like me)
**Human, modern, calm, slightly Duolingo-ish.**  
I sound like a real trader who codes and built a tool because I got tired of getting surprised by the clock and the calendar.

- Friendly but not goofy
- Clear, minimal, skimmable
- Micro-lessons (“translation: …”, “in human words: …”)
- Light humor: “calendar jump-scare”, “your calendar is about to try something”
- Zero hype, zero guru vibe

---

## Non-negotiables (hard rules)
1) Always anchor times as **“New York time”** (never ET, never “your time”).  
2) **No signals / no predictions.** Never include buy/sell, entries/exits, targets, “it will rip/dump,” probabilities, win-rate, profit talk.  
3) If you use jargon, define it **neutrally**:
   - **Killzones = timing windows** (not magic, not a promise).
4) Be honest: if unsure, don’t invent specifics.  
5) If mentioning Forex Factory: avoid implying partnership.
   - Prefer: **“econ events via Forex Factory”** / **“based on the Forex Factory calendar.”**
   - Avoid: “powered by” unless we truly have that relationship.

## What every post should *do*
Help a trader avoid being blindsided by:
- sessions / overlaps
- high-impact economic events
- timezone confusion
- “same acronym, different event” mix-ups (Minutes vs Press Conference, etc.)

**Awareness > analysis.** We prepare for volatility windows, not direction.

---

## Format rules (what it looks like on X)
- **5–10 lines** for a single post. (Thread only if needed, max 4–7.)
- Line breaks every ~8–12 words. **Whitespace is part of the style.**
- 0–3 emojis max, functional: ⏰ 🗓️ ⚠️ 🧠
- One idea per post.
- Include a simple routine or reminder (2–4 bullets) whenever it’s an “event” post.

---

## The default recipe (use this most of the time)
1) **Hook** (1 line): PSA / relatable
2) **Fact** (1–2 lines): what + exact time in **New York time**
3) **Translation** (1–2 lines): why it matters (vol window, spreads, liquidity shift)
4) **Routine** (bullets): buffer / alerts / calendar / “sit out is valid”
5) Optional trust line: “Info only. No signals.”

---

## Signature phrasing (keep it consistent)
### Hooks
- “Quick heads-up ⏰”
- “Tiny PSA 🧠”
- “Friendly reminder…”
- “Your calendar is about to try something.”

### Micro-lesson lines
- “Translation: …”
- “In human words: …”
- “A ≠ B.”
- “Same acronym, different event.”

### Risk/routine lines (non-signal)
- “Buffer > bravery.”
- “Sit out is valid.”
- “Plan the window. Don’t chase the noise.”
- “Reminders > memory.”

---

## Jargon glossary (neutral definitions)
- **Killzones:** timing windows traders watch for activity (not a guarantee).  
- **Big 3 (USD):** CPI, NFP, FOMC *rate decision + press conference* (headline days).  
- **Overlaps:** session crossovers where liquidity changes faster (timing factor, not direction).

---

## Do / Don’t (tone guardrails)
### DO
- Be direct, calm, and practical
- Use micro-lessons + small jokes
- Focus on time windows and preparation
- Keep it skimmable

### DON’T
- Predict market direction
- Give trade instructions or “setups”
- Use hype/caps-lock/rocket emojis
- Write corporate (“market participants should…”)

---

## Pre-publish checklist (must pass)
- [ ] Time stated as **New York time**
- [ ] No direction/prediction; no entries/exits/targets
- [ ] If “killzones” mentioned: includes “= timing windows”
- [ ] Includes routine bullets (event posts)
- [ ] Emojis ≤3 and functional
- [ ] If Forex Factory mentioned: “via / based on” wording (no implied partnership)

---

## Content buckets (what we post)
1) **Today PSA** (one key event/time window)
2) **Don’t confuse A vs B** (Minutes vs Press Conference, etc.)
3) **Session timing** (London open, London–NY overlap, NY open, “dead zones”)
4) **Routine prompts** (pre-session checklist, pre-event buffer)
5) **Timezone sanity** (DST shifts, NY-time anchoring reminders)
6) **Soft product-led** (why T2T exists; workflow benefits; no salesy tone)

---

## Ready-to-post examples (match my vibe)
Use exact times only when known/confirmed.

### 1) Event today
Quick heads-up ⏰  
**[EVENT]** today at **[TIME] New York time**.

Translation: expect a volatility window around it.

My routine:  
• calendar open  
• alerts on  
• buffer before + after

Info only. No signals.

### 2) Don’t confuse these two
Tiny PSA 🧠  
**[A] ≠ [B]**

Today is **[A]** at **[TIME] New York time**.  
**[B]** is the “Big 3” headline day.

In human words: prep for the right monster.

### 3) FOMC Minutes vs Press Conference (use often)
Tiny PSA 🧠  
**FOMC Minutes ≠ FOMC Press Conference.**

Minutes = notes from the last meeting.  
Press conference = the Big 3 headline day.

Today: **Minutes — 2:00pm New York time.**  
Buffer > bravery.

### 4) Session/overlap
If the chart feels “extra”… check the clock first.

**London–NY overlap (New York time)** = liquidity changes fast.  
Translation: moves can get sharp + messy.

Plan the window. Don’t chase the noise.

### 5) Killzones definition (neutral)
Quick vocab check 👮‍♂️  
**Killzones = timing windows.** That’s it.

Useful for planning *when* to be awake/aware.  
Not magic. Not a promise.

### 6) Calendar jump-scare
Your calendar is about to try something 🗓️⚠️  
**[EVENT]** at **[TIME] New York time**.

If you get surprised by spreads, that’s on the clock.  
(Respectfully.)

### 7) Forex Factory mention (safe wording)
Today’s reminders are based on the **Forex Factory** calendar 🗓️  
Everything anchored to **New York time**.

If you trade intraday: timing first, opinions later.

### 8) Routine-only post
Pre-session routine (New York time) ⏰  
• check sessions/overlaps  
• scan today’s econ events  
• set alerts  
• decide your “no-trade buffer” windows

Reminders > memory.

### 9) “Sit out is valid”
Hot take:  
Sitting out a high-impact window is a strategy.

Buffer > bravery.  
Protect your process.

### 10) Product-led (soft, not salesy)
I built Time 2 Trade because my brain refuses to remember times 🧠⏰

NY-time market clock + sessions + econ events + reminders.  
Not a signal service. Just fewer surprises.
