            <h1><strong>Time 2 Trade</strong></h1>
            <p>Time 2 Trade is a straightforward, powerful tool for futures and forex day traders at every level. Whether you’re just starting out or have years of experience, this app helps you keep track of the market’s key moments by turning time into clear, visual insights.</p>

            <h2><strong>About Time 2 Trade</strong></h2>
            <p>Trading is often seen as a solitary and abstract pursuit. With Time 2 Trade, you can actually see when the most important parts of your trading day are taking place. The app uses a dynamic clock display where “killzones”—customizable colored arcs—mark crucial market periods. In this design, the inner circle represents AM hours, while the outer circle shows PM hours, giving you a quick overview of the day’s sessions.</p>

            <h3><strong>Key Features</strong></h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Killzones Visualization:</strong><br />The clock displays your defined trading sessions as colored arcs. Customize the start and end times as well as the colors for each killzone, so you can easily tell when key market moments are active.<br /><br /></li>
            <li><strong>Customizable Clock Settings:</strong><br />Choose from a variety of clock sizes—from a compact “Tiny” version to a bold “Huge” display. An intuitive sidebar makes it simple to adjust both the clock’s appearance and your killzone settings.<br /><br /></li>
