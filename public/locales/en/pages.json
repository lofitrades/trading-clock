      "descriptionContinued": "Time 2 Trade solves this by combining two things: a visual session clock that answers \"where am I in the trading day right now?\" and an economic calendar that answers \"what's coming next?\" The goal is simple: reduce timing friction so you can keep a consistent, disciplined process."
